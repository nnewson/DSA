# DSA
Various algos and data structures written to embed how they work, for enjoyment, in Python and C++.

Code by me (reviewed by an LLM), and tests by an LLM (reviewed by me).

Currently I've created a Bloom filter in Python anmd C++ 20, which you can find here:
[Bloom filter](https://github.com/nnewson/DSA/tree/main/bloomFilter)

I intend to add a Red-Black tree implementation next, then a B-tree, and then tie them together into a SSTable / LSM tree implmentation.
